# Introduction to Fleek

Fleek is a service that lets you host a website on IPFS without needing to install anything on your computer or run command-line scripts.

IPFS is content addressed, which means when you look up a file you're asking the network to find a node that stores the content hash. If the content changes, the hash changes. This can be a challenge if youâ€˜re constantly adding or updating content. The process of rehashing, adding, and [updating domain names](/how-to/websites-on-ipfs/link-a-domain/#dns) is cumbersome and time consuming.

Fleek offers a simple workflow. Once you've pushed your changes to Git Fleek handles updating, pinning, and deploying the changes. Fleek integrates well with React, Next.js, Gatsby, Jekyll, Hugo, and [others](https://docs.fleek.co/Sites/Frameworks). You can also manage your domains through Fleek, and monitor your sites in a similar method to traditional web development.

If you're looking to host a fast website on IPFS, Fleek is a great option!
