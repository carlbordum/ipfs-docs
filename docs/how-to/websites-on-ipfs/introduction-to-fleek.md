# Introduction to Fleek

Fleek is a service that lets you host a website on IPFS, without the need to install anything on your computer or run command-line scripts. This guide will cover the basics of Fleek, the benefits of the service, and some limitations it currently has.

IPFS is content addressed, which means when you look up a file, you're asking the network to find a node that stores the content hash. If the content changes, the hash changes. This can be a challenge if youâ€˜re constantly adding or updating content. The process of rehashing, adding, and [updating domain names](/how-to/websites-on-ipfs/link-a-domain/#dns) is time consuming.

Fleek offers a simple workflow: push your changes to Git, and Fleek will handle updating, pinning, and deploying the changes. Fleek integrates well with React, Next.js, Gatsby, Jekyll, Hugo, and [others](https://docs.fleek.co/Sites/Frameworks). You can also manage your domains through Fleek, and monitor your sites in a similar method to traditional web development.

If you're looking to host a fast website on IPFS, Fleek is a great option!
