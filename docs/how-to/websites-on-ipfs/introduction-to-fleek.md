# Introduction to Fleek

Fleek is a service that lets you host a website on IPFS, without the need to install anything on your computer or run command-line scripts. This guide will cover the basics of Fleek, the benefits of the service, and some limitations it currently has.

IPFS is content addressed, which means when you look up a file, you're asking the network to find a node that stores the content hash. If the content changes, the hash changes. This can be a challenge if youâ€˜re constantly adding or updating content. The process of rehashing, adding, and [updating domain names](/how-to/websites-on-ipfs/link-a-domain/#dns) is time consuming.

Fleek offers a simple workflow. Push changes to Git and Fleek will handle updating, pinning and deploying changes downstream. Fleek integrates well with many front end [frameworks](https://docs.fleek.co/Sites/Frameworks) such as React, NextJs, Gatsby, Jekyll Hugo etc. It also provides custom domains, and site monitoring known in traditional web development.

If you're looking to build a fast front end website, Fleek can be a great option.
